# Background
I recently purchased a new truck (Ram 1500 3.6L V6 Flexfuel) and I am excited about how high my MPG is. I took that excitement for my high gas mileage as the motivation I needed to finally create an Android app in c# using Xamarin. Up to now, I have only followed tutorials in my app development, and I have never actually installed the app onto a physical device.
